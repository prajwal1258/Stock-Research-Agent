Created Stock Research Report Agent workflow

Stock Analysis Report Workflow for n8n This n8n workflow automates the generation and delivery of detailed stock analysis reports using various integrated tools. It is designed to trigger on a user request, analyze stock charts, and send a comprehensive report via email, leveraging AI-powered image analysis and seamless communication channels.
Workflow Overview Input Trigger The workflow starts by receiving a trigger input—this could be an incoming message or API call containing a stock ticker symbol from the user.
Set Ticker The ticker symbol from the input is extracted and set as a variable, which serves as the key identifier for all subsequent stock-related operations.
Get Chart URL Using the ticker, the workflow queries a financial data source or charting API to retrieve the URL of the latest stock price chart.
Download Chart The chart image is downloaded from the URL for further processing. This step ensures that the latest visual data is available for analysis.
Image Analysis via AI Model The downloaded chart image is analyzed using an AI model specialized in visual stock pattern recognition. The model extracts technical indicators, trends, support/resistance levels, and momentum signals essential for the final report.
Upload File from URL (Chat Messenger) For collaboration or user feedback, the chart or analysis results can be uploaded and shared via a chat messenger. This facilitates real-time communication around the stock data.
Response Ticker The workflow formats a structured response containing the analyzed insights linked to the ticker symbol, ready for delivery.
Send Email via Gmail The final comprehensive stock analysis report, including AI-driven insights and chart visuals, is sent to the user’s email through the Gmail integration. This ensures effective and professional report delivery.
This workflow combines powerful automation, AI, and communication tools in n8n, streamlining stock research and making detailed, actionable insights accessible efficiently. It is suited for analysts, investors, and financial consultants who need real-time, data-driven stock reports without manual overhead.
